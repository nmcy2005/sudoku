# This is a not finished Sudoku game a friend wanted me to help him add

- ## Basic idea behind that:
  - You choose a number from the select panel at the bottom
  - This number will be saved in the variable **selectedNumber**
  - Then, when you **click** on a grid item on the grid, it will add an image (of the **selectedNUmber**) to the clicked square
